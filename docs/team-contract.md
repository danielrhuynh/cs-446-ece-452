## Communication

- Our team will use an iMessage group chat to communicate project-related matters
- We will meet every week in-person/online if necessary, but will strive to do all project-related matters asynchronously where possible by creating stories and subtasks

## Meetings

- All members will attend these meetings or notify the team in advance of anticipated absences. We all agree that absences should be rare
- All group members will come to the meetings prepared by:
  - reading the assigned material (as much as possible), and
  - coming with ideas pertaining to the tasks and decisions to be made
- Members will not work on other assignments during meetings and will be engaged
- Decisions can be made during meetings even some members are absent
- Each member will take turns listening as well as talking, and active listening will be a strategy for all group discussions

- Leo will post the agenda for the week in our group chat each Monday
- David will take notes during all meetings
